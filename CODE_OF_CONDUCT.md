# WorldWide Telescope Code of Conduct

WorldWide Telescope is dedicated to providing a welcoming and
supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to
historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged.
Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics
such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy,
citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or
belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority,
property, birth, age, or operating system preference. We do not tolerate
harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other
reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause
discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of
communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we
have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our community,
regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not
limited to:

- written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the
  basis of membership of a specific group listed above
- causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking,
  following, or intimidation
- the display of sexual or violent images
- unwelcome sexual attention
- nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact
- sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm
- continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with
  someone after being asked to stop
- publication of private communication without consent

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The
list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it
easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All
interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is
prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to
both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any
harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

This code of conduct is based on a the one used by
[Software and Data Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/) which
itself is a modified version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked
from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism
Wiki. Contributors to this document: Adam Obeng, Aleksandra Pawlik, Bill
