# Contributing to WorldWide Telescope

We would love for you to contribute to our repositories to make WWT easier for others to use and to help others get the most out of WWT. Here are some guidelines:

* Code of Conduct
* Question or problem?
* Feature request
* Bug fixes

## Code of Conduct
You must follow our [code of conduct](conduct.md)

## Question or Problem?
If you have a question or problem please post it to our (not yet existant) mailing list.

## Feature Requests
Small feature requests can be opened as issues in the appropriate github repository. Larger feature requests should be sent to wwt@aas.org until we reactivate our forum and mailing list.

## Mistaken, outdated, or missing documentation
If you find a mistake in the documentation, or that it is outdated, or that there is a missing piece, you can help us by submitting an issue to the appropriate GitHub Repository. Even better you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. If you aren't sure which repository to chose, please open an issue to this repository or email us: wwt@aas.org.

If you are working on part of the documentation please let others know so we minimize duplication of effort. Comment on or open a new issue letting everyone know what you're working on.
