# Welcome to the WorldWide Telescope Contributor Hub!

 with parentheses don't render well. -->
[WorldWide Telescope](http://www.worldwidetelescope.org) (WWT) is a free,
open-source tool for visually exploring humanity’s scientific understanding of
the Universe. WWT is primarily a website that allows anyone to interactively
explore terabytes of astronomical data in a seamlessly integrated 4D
simulation of the known universe. But the WWT software ecosystem also includes
a Windows application that can power planetariums, a cloud-based web service
for discovering and sharing astronomical data, and a Python module allowing
users to write their own software to control and extend all of these systems.

WorldWide Telescope is a fiscally sponsored project of
[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the
open-source scientific computing community. If you like WWT and want to support
our mission, consider making a [tax-deductible
donation](https://numfocus.org/donate-for-worldwide-telescope) to support our
efforts.

*NumFOCUS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity in the United States; as such,
donations to NumFOCUS are tax-deductible as allowed by law. As with any
donation, you should consult with your personal tax adviser or the IRS about
your particular tax situation.*
